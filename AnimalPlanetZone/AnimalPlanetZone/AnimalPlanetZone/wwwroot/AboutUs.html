            <h4>Animal Planet Zone</h4>
            <div>Come visit with us to experience a garden center 
            we've been told is like no other!  Whether you're a local 
            community member who has been shopping with us for decades, a new 
            customer, or someone visiting from out of town, we think you'll find a 
            trip to Plant and See will provide you with a natural setting for moments to explore hundreds of plant varieties, let your 
            creativity blossom, and nourish your spirit with the glory of the garden.</div>
            <div>The kingdom of animals is fascinating. The interaction, survival, and beauty of animals is worth understanding and studying.
            Not that we're biased or anything, but we think ducks are the best animals ever. Check out your favorite 
            animal or type of animal below to learn more about them. We also have lots of fun facts about animals, so enjoy, and 
            we hope you learn something about animals along the way.</div>
